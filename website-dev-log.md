# Website Dev Log

**Session Date:** 2025-04-24

## Session Overview
This session focused on enhancing the visual and functional experience of the portfolio site, improving Stripe integration, and refining the development workflow. We also captured key learnings and effective collaboration practices to accelerate future progress.

---

## Major Changes & Accomplishments

- **Projects Page Modernization**
  - Improved layout (padding, spacing, card sizing) for better visibility and aesthetics.
  - Added a featured project/service card with a clear value proposition and feature list.
  - Integrated a "Buy Now" button that opens a side drawer with a Stripe buy card for direct purchase.
  - Dynamically loaded the Stripe buy button script for performance and modularity.

- **Stripe Integration**
  - Used `<stripe-buy-button>` for seamless checkout.
  - Addressed TypeScript warning about custom elements (noted as safe to ignore or workaround).

- **Cursor Animation Overlay**
  - Solved the challenge of overlaying a custom cursor animation above a zoomed Spline scene, even after hiding the Spline logo.
  - Key solution: Render the cursor animation as a React component absolutely positioned above the Spline iframe, with `pointer-events: none` for perfect interactivity.
  - Refactored the animation logic into a reusable `<CanvasCursor />` component.

- **Git & Deployment Workflow**
  - Verified remote repo connection and current branch.
  - Merged feature branch into `main` and pushed live, confirming the deployment pipeline.

## Key "Aha" Moments & Technical Learnings

- **Layering Effects in React:**
  - Overlaying interactive or animated components (like a canvas cursor) is best done with absolute positioning and z-index, independent of underlying 3D/iframe content.

- **Custom Elements in TypeScript:**
  - TypeScript may warn about non-standard JSX elements (like `<stripe-buy-button>`). This can be safely ignored or handled with a custom type declaration if needed.

- **Effective Debugging:**
  - When a UI effect disappears after a layout change (e.g., zooming Spline), check the DOM stacking context and overlay logic first.

- **Direct Communication:**
  - Quick, clear questions ("Can you push to main?", "How do I check my remote?") keep the workflow smooth and minimize friction.

- **Proactive Documentation:**
  - Capturing session context, blockers, and solutions in a dev log accelerates onboarding and prevents repeated mistakes.

---

## Collaboration & Workflow Practices

- **User-First, Context-Aware:**
  - Prioritized clear explanations, previews, and explicit user consent before major actions.
  - Used concise summaries and actionable next steps.

- **Transparency:**
  - Documented all code changes, decisions, and learnings in context files.
  - Provided commit and deployment feedback for traceability.

- **Iterative & Incremental:**
  - Broke down complex changes into small, testable steps with regular check-ins.

---

## Next Steps / Open Questions
- Monitor the deployment for any issues or feedback.
- Consider extending the cursor overlay to other pages if desired.
- Continue to log key learnings and workflow improvements in this file.

**This session was highly productive, collaborative, and enjoyable!**
- All blockers were resolved.
- Communication was effective and user-centric.
- The project is now better documented for future work.

*Snapshot complete. Ready for the next build!*
